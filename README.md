**Car Sell Website**

This project is a web-based platform developed as part of my college project. It enables users to list and advertise their cars for sale while offering buyers the ability to search, view details, and contact sellers. The system includes essential features such as user registration, car listing and search functionality.

**Key Features:**

- 1. User registration for sellers to list their cars and for buyers to inquire about listings.
- 2. Car listing form where sellers can upload vehicle details, including images, make, model, and price.
- 3. A search page that allows buyers to filter results by different parameters such as make, model, and price.
- 4. Frontend designed with HTML and CSS to provide a responsive and clean user interface.
- 5. Backend functionalities handled through PHP to process user data, login, and manage car listings.
- 6. JavaScript included to handle form validations and search filtering.

**Technologies Used:**

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: PHP
- Database: MySQL (based on database.txt setup instructions)

This project showcases my ability to develop a full-stack web application using PHP for server-side logic and MySQL for data management, with a focus on delivering a user-friendly interface.
